                <h2>Entrepreneuship</h2>
                <p>Entrepreneurial mindset with a "Lean Startup" approach to tackle & validate assumption through experiments in order to innovate customer-centric solutions. I believe in early validation with the least amount of resources, also called pretotyping. I also believe that entrepreneurship is partly science and partly art, hence, I believe in embracing the chaos for coming up with radical innovations.

                    <p>Being a human-centered designer I push for customer-centric solutions. I am radically inspired by people and show create empathy for the user. In the design research I use qualitative research (eg by organising fieldwork, facilitating co-creation sessions, conducting contextual interviews, performing usability studies, etc.). I interpret and translate rich user insights towards a clear vision for innovative products, services, spaces, interactions and experiences. I test early prototypes iteratively with users to move ideas closer to market launch.

I believe in connecting research & design to come up with novel solutions. I love digging into a vast and diverse amount of data and information to come up with new insights.

Storytelling continues beyond the pitch, hence, using as many channels as possible to deliver your story using various media formats (video, audio or text).
